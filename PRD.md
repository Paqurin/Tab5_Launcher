- ✅ 60fps smooth UI performance with LVGL
- ✅ Zero-crash file operations under normal use
- ✅ Complete Python execution environment
- ✅ Professional development experience matching original
- ✅ Memory usage within ESP32-P4 constraints (<2MB RAM)
- ✅ Boot time under 5 seconds
- ✅ File operation response time under 500ms

## Technical Constraints

### Hardware Limitations
- **ESP32-P4 Memory**: 768KB SRAM, external PSRAM required
- **M5Stack Tab5 Display**: 1280x720 resolution, capacitive touch
- **Storage**: SD card (FAT32) + internal SPIFFS
- **Network**: WiFi limitations on ESP32-P4 platform

### Software Requirements
- **ESP-IDF 5.4.1**: Framework compatibility and stability
- **LVGL 9.3.0**: Modern UI framework integration
- **M5Stack Tab5 BSP**: Hardware abstraction layer
- **Existing codebase**: Maintain compatibility with current Tab5_Launcher

### Performance Requirements

- Establish LVGL-based file management UI
- Core file operations implementation
- Configuration system migration

### Phase 2: Core Features (Sprints 3-6)  
- Complete text editor implementation
- Python launcher integration
- Advanced file operations
- OTA and firmware management

### Phase 3: Web Interface (Sprints 7-8)
- HTTP server implementation  
- Embedded web UI with advanced features
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design

### Phase 4: Polish & Production (Sprints 9-12)
- Configuration management completion
- UI/UX enhancements and animations
- Comprehensive testing and optimization
- Advanced features and production readiness

## Risk Mitigation
- **Memory Constraints**: Implement efficient memory management from start
- **Performance**: Continuous profiling and optimization
- **Hardware Limitations**: Work within ESP32-P4 constraints
- **Complexity**: Incremental development with testing at each sprint
- **Integration**: Maintain compatibility with existing Tab5_Launcher base

## Success Criteria Validation
- **Functional Testing**: All features work as specified
- **Performance Testing**: Meets all timing and memory requirements
- **Integration Testing**: Seamless operation with M5Stack Tab5 hardware
- **User Testing**: Intuitive and professional user experience
- **Reliability Testing**: Stable operation under stress conditions
